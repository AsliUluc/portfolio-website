<h1 class="title">My favorite city so far...</h1>
<p>Although there are still hundreds of other beautiful places to see in the world, one of my favorite cities is Chania.</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="chania" class="content">Why Chania?</h2>
<div class="chania">
    <div>
<p> Chania (also spelled: Hania) is the capital city, a place where different civilizations have flourished throughout the centuries. Strolling around the Old Townâ€™s maze-like alleys with the beautiful Venetian mansions, the fountains and the churches will guide you through well-preserved historical monuments.</p>

<p>The city of Chania is built on the area of Minoan Kidonia, at the end of the homonym gulf between Akrotiri and Onicha peninsulas. It was the former capital city of Crete (from 1847 until 1972). Nowadays, it is the second largest city of Crete after Heraklion and capital of the homonym prefecture.</p>

<p>Get familiar with the city of Chania by wandering around in its streets, visiting its museums and admiring the different architectural styles presenting the historical route of the city.</p>

<h2 id="recommendation" class="rec">Where in Chania?</h2>
<h3>Old Town</h3>
<div class="chania">
    <img src="https://www.discovergreece.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2019-11/1_venetian_port_of_chania_-1.jpg?itok=7pWncKvS" width="300" height="300">
    <div><p>The borders of the Old Town are the partly destroyed old Venetian wall (and bulwarks) and this has been the cradle of all the
            civilizations which were developed in the area. The central part of the old town is named Kasteli and has been inhabited since
            Neolithic times (ancient Kydonia). It is located on a small hill right next to the seafront and has always been the ideal
            place for a settlement due to its secure position, its location next to the harbour and its proximity to the fertile valley in
            the south. Nowadays it is a bit more quiet than the neighbouring areas of the west part of the district. The Splantzia quarter
            (next to the east part of Kasteli) is also largely untouched.</p>
